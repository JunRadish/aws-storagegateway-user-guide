# Deploying a Volume or Tape Gateway on an Amazon EC2 Host<a name="ec2-gateway-common"></a>

You can deploy and activate a volume or tape gateway on an Amazon EC2 instance\. You can use gateways hosted on Amazon EC2 instances for disaster recovery and data mirroring\. An EC2 Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) is available in the AWS Marketplace\. For volume gateway and tape gateways, we recommend using the **Launch from Website** option\.

**Note**  
Amazon EC2 AMIs that are provided through AWS Marketplace might not be available in all AWS Regions\.

1. On AWS Marketplace, choose **Continue to Subscribe** and choose **Continue to Configuration** on the next page\. If this is your first time using a Storage Gateway AMI, accept the terms of service\.

1. On the **Configure this Software** page, choose a value for **Fulfilment Option**, **Software Version**, and **Region**, and then choose **Continue to Launch**\.

1. On the **Launch this Software** page, choose **Launch from Website**\.

1. For **EC2 Instance Type**, choose an instance type\. For information about supported instance types, see [Requirements for Amazon EC2 Instance Types](Requirements.md#requirements-hardware-ec2)\.

1. For **Subnet Settings**, choose the subnet that you want to launch your instance in\.

1. For **Security Group Settings**, choose a security group\. You can choose the default security group for Storage Gateway\.

   The Launch from Website feature comes with an autogenerated security group that is named `AWS Storage Gateway-1-0-AutogenByAWSMP`\. For information about how to set up security group settings, see [Configuring Security Groups for Your Amazon EC2 Gateway Instance](Requirements.md#EC2GatewayCustomSecurityGroup-common)\. 

1. For **Key Pair Settings**, choose the key pair that you want to launch your AMI with\. If you don't have a key pair, you can create one\.

1. Choose **Launch** and then choose **EC2 Console** to see your instance in the Amazon EC2 console\.

   EC2 instances launched from the website come with one root Amazon EBS volume\. If you need to add additional EBS volumes to your instance, do so as a separate step after your instance is launched\. For information about how to add EBS volumes, see [Attaching an Amazon EBS Volume to an Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide//ebs-attaching-volume.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances\.*

1. In the Amazon EC2 console, choose your Amazon EC2 instance, choose the **Description** tab at the bottom, and then note the IP address\. You use this IP address to connect to the gateway\.
