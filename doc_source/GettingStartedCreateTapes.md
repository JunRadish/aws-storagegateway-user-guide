**Note**  
You are charged only for the amount of data you write to the tape, not the tape capacity\.

**To create virtual tapes**

1. In the navigation pane, choose the **Gateways** tab\.

1. Choose **Create tapes** to open the **Create tape** dialog box\.

1. For **Gateway**, choose a gateway\. The tape is created for this gateway\.

1. For **Number of tapes**, choose the number of tapes you want to create\. For more information about tape limits, see [AWS Storage Gateway Limits](resource-gateway-limits.md)\.

1. For **Capacity**, type the size of the virtual tape you want to create\. Tapes must be larger than 100 GiB\. For information about capacity limits, see [AWS Storage Gateway Limits](resource-gateway-limits.md)\.

1. For **Barcode prefix**, type the prefix you want to prepend to the barcode of your virtual tapes\. 
**Note**  
Virtual tapes are uniquely identified by a barcode\. You can add a prefix to the barcode\. The prefix is optional, but you can use it to help identify your virtual tapes\. The prefix must be uppercase letters \(Aâ€“Z\) and must be one to four characters long\.

1. Choose **Create tapes**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose the **Tapes** tab to see your tapes\.

The status of the virtual tapes is initially set to **CREATING** when the virtual tapes are being created\. After the tapes are created, their status changes to **AVAILABLE**\. For more information, see [Managing Your Tape Gateway](managing-gateway-vtl.md)\.
