# Working with Open\-Source Components for AWS Storage Gateway<a name="AboutAWSStorageGatewaySoftware"></a>

The source code for certain open\-source software components that are included with the AWS Storage Gateway software is available for download at the following locations:
+  [https://s3\.amazonaws\.com/aws\-storage\-gateway\-terms/sources\.tar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-storage-gateway-terms/sources.tar) for gateways deployed on VMware ESXi\.
+ [https://s3\.amazonaws\.com/aws\-storage\-gateway\-terms/sources\_hyperv\.tar](https://s3.amazonaws.com//aws-storage-gateway-terms/sources_hyperv.tar) for gateways deployed on Microsoft Hyper\-V

This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit \([http://www\.openssl\.org/](http://www.openssl.org/)\)\. 

The packages that make up the AWS Storage Gateway VM are tracked and monitored for security vulnerabilities\. When updates are issued, they are applied to each gateway and the updated packages will increment their version number, although the major version number of the Linux distribution might not increment\.
