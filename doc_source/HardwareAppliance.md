# Using the AWS Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance<a name="HardwareAppliance"></a>

The AWS Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance is a hardware appliance that provides AWS Storage Gateway software that is preinstalled on a third\-party server\. You can manage your AWS Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance from the **Hardware** page on the AWS Management Console\.

When creating a new gateway based on AWS Storage Gateway in the console, you have the option to do so by using the AWS Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance\. You can also use virtual platforms on VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper\-V, and Amazon EC2\. If you don't already own a hardware appliance and choose to use one, you are directed to purchase one at [Buy on Amazon\.com](https://api.aws-gw.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BuyRedirect ) on the Amazon\.com site\. You can also choose **Buy Hardware Appliance** on the **Hardware** page of the Storage Gateway console to purchase a hardware appliance from the same Amazon\.com page\.

Each hardware appliance is a high\-performance 1U server that you can deploy in your data center, or on\-premises inside your corporate firewall\. In the sections that follow, you can find instructions about how to purchase and deploy an AWS Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance\.

When you activate your hardware appliance, the activation process associates your hardware appliance with your AWS account\. Your hardware appliance then appears in the console as a gateway on the **Hardware** page\. You can configure your hardware appliance to have a file, tape, or volume gateway by using the same procedures that you use to install these gateway types on a virtual appliance\.
